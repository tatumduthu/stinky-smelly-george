## User Story
As an IT student currently in a web development course I wanted to make 
an app to track where and when I am parking on campus so that I get an 
idea of where the best places to park are depending on the time of day!

## Narrative
-The use of this app is to track what time i got to campus, the date, the 
parking lot, and any other additional information--for example, maybe how 
long it too me to find a parking spot since it takes AWHILE sometimes...

-This project has been a work in process, since I began it In late January
2025 for my first web development project. Since I am at the end of this 
course now, we have revisited this project to upgrade it with all the 
cool new things we have learned.

### Code snippet from original project
- This is code for the first card that displays my parking app project
```json
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h4 class="card-title">Parking Blog</h4>
        <img class="card-img-top img-thumbnail" src="images/parkingAppPreview.png" alt="Card image">
