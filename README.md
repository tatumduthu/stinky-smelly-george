## User Story
As an IT student currently in a web development course I wanted to make 
an app to track where and when I am parking on campus so that I get an 
idea of where the best places to park are depending on the time of day!

## Narrative
-The use of this app is to track what time i got to campus, the date, the 
parking lot, and any other additional information--for example, maybe how 
long it too me to find a parking spot since it takes AWHILE sometimes...

-This project has been a work in process, since I began it In late January
2025 for my first web development project. Since I am at the end of this 
course now, we have revisited this project to upgrade it with all the 
cool new things we have learned.

### Code Snippet: original project
This is code for the dropdown button to select the parking lot that you parked in.
It has the label, parking ID, and breaks inserted at the end to separate the questions
for the parking form.
```json
<label for="wheredPark"><strong>Where'd you park?</strong></label><br>
    <select id="wheredPark" required> 
      <option value="">Select a parking lot</option>
      <option value="Appleby">Appleby</option>
      <option value="Church">Church</option>
      <option value="Lot O">Lot O</option>
      <option value="Parking Deck">Parking Deck</option>
      <option value="Rice/Rivers">Rice/Rivers</option>
      <option value="Other">Other</option>
    </select><br><br>

```

### Code Snippet: This project
This is new code implemented into this project for the nav bar. The nav bar has
many options such as my Github profile, the source code, wireframe, etc.
```json
<label for="wheredPark"><strong>Where'd you park?</strong></label><br>
    <select id="wheredPark" required> 
      <option value="">Select a parking lot</option>
      <option value="Appleby">Appleby</option>
      <option value="Church">Church</option>
      <option value="Lot O">Lot O</option>
      <option value="Parking Deck">Parking Deck</option>
      <option value="Rice/Rivers">Rice/Rivers</option>
      <option value="Other">Other</option>
    </select><br><br>

```
