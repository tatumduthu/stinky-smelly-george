## User Story
As an IT student currently in a web development I wanted to make an app 
to track where and when I am parking on campus so that I get an idea of 
where the best places to park are depending on the time of day!

## Narrative
The use of this app is to track what time i got to campus, the day, the 
parking lot,and any other additional information--for example, maybe how 
long it too me to find a parking spot since it takes AWHILE sometimes...

-This project has been a work in process, since I began it In late January
2025 for my first web development project. Since I am at the end of this 
course now, we have revisited this project to upgrade it with all the 
cool new things we have learned.
