## User Story
As an IT student currently in a web development course I wanted to make 
an app to track where and when I am parking on campus so that I get an 
idea of where the best places to park are depending on the time of day!

## Narrative
-The use of this app is to track what time i got to campus, the date, the 
parking lot, and any other additional information--for example, maybe how 
long it too me to find a parking spot since it takes AWHILE sometimes...

-This project has been a work in process, since I began it In late January
2025 for my first web development project. Since I am at the end of this 
course now, we have revisited this project to upgrade it with all the 
cool new things we have learned.

### Code Snippet: original project
This is code for the original project that I did. Once you filled out the data
it got stored in a table
![original table](images/table.jpg)

```json
<table id="parkingTable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Parking Lot</th> 
      <th>Time</th>                  
      <th>Additional Info</th>                  
    </tr>                    
  </thead>                   
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2025-01-14</td>                   
      <td>Rice/Rivers</td>                  
      <td>10:42</td>                  
      <td>Rainy, cold day</td>     
    </tr>                   
    <tr>                   
      <td>2025-01-16</td>                   
      <td>Church</td>                  
      <td>10:40</td>                  
      <td>Clear, sunny, chill day</td>                       
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```

### Code Snippet: This project
This is new code implemented into this project for the nav bar. The nav bar has
many options such as my Github profile, the source code, wireframe, etc.
```json
<div class="topnav">
  <a href="#home" class="active"><strong>Dev GeorgeðŸ¦­</strong></a>
